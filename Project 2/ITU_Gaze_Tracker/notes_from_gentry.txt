1) we've updated calculatedegreesleft in interpolation.cs on line 211

2) we've found that we need to select remote monocular in the dropdown menu.
	This will call calibPolynomial rather than calibPupil

3) GTSettings.cs has kind of a switchboard for many differecnt setting including distance from screen which is currently 600mm

4) CalibPolynomial is using a least squares regression to solve for xLeft and yLeft. The results end up in CalibrationDataLeft

5) Save the return value of calculatedegreesleft() in CalibrationDataLeft.AverageError, which is currently an int. Change the type?
	No, set CalibrationDataLeft.AverageError inside of the mmtodeg method

6) Distance is calculated in Operation.cs. The Distance method returns the square root of the difference of the squares. These returns are averaged in Interpolation.cs which is an accurate calculation of Spatial Precision.

7) The stdDeviationGazeCoordinatesLeft member belongs to each Calibration target. Their mean is the spatial precision of the rig.
